# üßø Third Eye MCP - Testing Guide

## üö® CRITICAL: Third Eye is a STRICT VALIDATION OVERSEER

Third Eye **NEVER** generates content. It **ONLY** validates complete work packages against quality standards. **ALL FIELDS ARE MANDATORY** - incomplete submissions will be **REJECTED IMMEDIATELY**.

## Testing Your Integration

### 1. Basic Connection Test

First, verify your MCP connection is working:

```json
{
  "payload": {
    "intent": "Test Third Eye validation system",
    "work": {
      "code": "print('Hello, Third Eye!')"
    },
    "context_info": {
      "language": "python",
      "purpose": "testing"
    }
  },
  "reasoning_md": "Testing the Third Eye MCP integration to ensure validation pipeline is working correctly."
}
```

**Expected Response**: Validation results with `ok: true` and analysis of the simple code.

### 2. Incomplete Submission Tests

#### ‚ùå Test Missing Intent
```json
{
  "payload": {
    "work": {"code": "print('test')"},
    "context_info": {"language": "python"}
  },
  "reasoning_md": "This should fail"
}
```

**Expected Response**: `ok: false` with error "intent is required (minimum 5 characters)"

#### ‚ùå Test Empty Work
```json
{
  "payload": {
    "intent": "Validate this code",
    "work": {},
    "context_info": {"language": "python"}
  },
  "reasoning_md": "This should fail"
}
```

**Expected Response**: `ok: false` with error "work is required and must contain at least one property"

#### ‚ùå Test Missing Context
```json
{
  "payload": {
    "intent": "Validate this code",
    "work": {"code": "print('test')"}
  },
  "reasoning_md": "This should fail"
}
```

**Expected Response**: `ok: false` with error "context_info is required and must contain at least one property"

#### ‚ùå Test Short Reasoning
```json
{
  "payload": {
    "intent": "Validate this code",
    "work": {"code": "print('test')"},
    "context_info": {"language": "python"}
  },
  "reasoning_md": "Short"
}
```

**Expected Response**: `ok: false` with error "reasoning_md is required (minimum 10 characters)"

## Validation Type Tests

      "draft": "# Kubernetes Performance Optimization in 2024\n\nKubernetes has evolved significantly in recent years, with version 1.28 introducing several performance improvements that can dramatically impact cluster efficiency.\n\n## Resource Management Improvements\n\nThe new **CPU Manager** policies in Kubernetes 1.28 can improve performance by up to 40% for CPU-intensive workloads. This is achieved through better CPU affinity and reduced context switching.\n\n## Memory Optimization\n\n**Memory QoS** improvements now allow for more precise memory allocation, reducing memory waste by approximately 25% in typical enterprise deployments. The enhanced cgroup v2 support provides better memory isolation.\n\n## Network Performance\n\n**CNI performance** has been significantly improved with the introduction of eBPF-based networking solutions. Cilium 1.14 shows 60% better throughput compared to traditional iptables-based solutions.\n\n## Storage Improvements\n\n**CSI drivers** in Kubernetes 1.28 support snapshot cloning, which can reduce backup times by 80% for large persistent volumes.\n\n## Autoscaling Enhancements\n\nThe **Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)** now supports in-place resource updates, eliminating the need for pod restarts and reducing downtime by 95% during scaling operations.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. Use resource quotas to prevent resource contention\n2. Implement proper node affinity rules\n3. Enable cluster autoscaling with predictive scaling\n4. Use horizontal pod autoscaling with custom metrics\n5. Optimize container images to reduce startup time\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThese optimizations can result in significant cost savings, with enterprises reporting 30-50% reduction in infrastructure costs when properly implemented."

## Integration Verification

### Verify MCP Bridge is Working
1. Check logs: `./start.sh logs mcp-bridge`
2. Verify API connection: Check for successful requests in Third Eye API logs
3. Test tool availability: Ensure `third-eye/oversee` appears in your AI tool's available functions

### Troubleshooting Checklist
