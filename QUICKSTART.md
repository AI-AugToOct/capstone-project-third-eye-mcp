# ðŸš€ Third Eye MCP - Quickstart Guide

## ðŸ”° Never used Docker or AI tools before? No problem!



### Step 1: Install Docker Desktop
1. Download from: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
2. Install and start it (look for whale icon in system tray)
3. That's it! Docker includes everything you need.

### Step 2: Get a Free GROQ API Key (2 minutes)
1. Visit: https://console.groq.com/keys
2. Sign up (free tier available)
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the key (starts with `gsk_`)

### Step 3: Launch Third Eye
```bash
# Clone this repo (or download/extract ZIP)
cd capstone-project-third-eye-mcp

# Run the interactive launcher
./start.sh

# Choose option 1: Start services
# The system will guide you through adding your GROQ key
```

That's it! The system auto-generates admin credentials and sets everything up.

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Launch (if you have Docker + GROQ key)

```bash
# Method 1: Interactive (recommended for first time)
./start.sh start

# Method 2: Direct start (if .env already configured)
./start.sh start

# Method 3: Demo mode (no GROQ key needed)
./start.sh start --non-interactive
```
